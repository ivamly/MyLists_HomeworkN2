# Custom Data Structures: LinkedList and ArrayList

This repository contains custom implementations of LinkedList and ArrayList created as part of an assignment for the Aston education course.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental data structures, `LinkedList` and `ArrayList`, in Java. These data structures are designed to mimic the functionality of the standard Java `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` classes.

### LinkedList

A `LinkedList` is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation includes basic operations such as adding, removing, and searching for elements.

### ArrayList

An `ArrayList` is a dynamic array that resizes itself as elements are added or removed. This implementation includes basic operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.
